## üìù Why I Chose to Associate Logs with Projects

In designing the interaction log system, I decided to associate **Interaction Logs** with 
**projects** rather than directly with **clients**. This approach reflects a more modular and scalable structure that aligns with real-world business needs ‚Äî where a single client may be involved in multiple distinct projects, each with its own objectives, timeline, and communication flow.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Linking Logs to Projects

- **Contextual Relevance**  
  Each log is tied to a specific project, which helps maintain clear and relevant communication history. This reduces ambiguity and avoids mixing up messages across multiple projects under the same client.

- **Easier Management**  
  Logs can be filtered, managed, and analyzed based on projects. This makes it simpler to track progress, follow up on tasks, or review past interactions in an organized way.

- **Scalability & Future Extensions**  
  This structure makes room for future improvements, such as:
  - Generating project-specific reports and analytics
  - Assigning different team members to different projects
  - Tracking performance on a per-project basis
 

### üß© Summary

By linking logs to projects, the CRM system stays clean, maintainable, and flexible ‚Äî making it easier to manage complex client relationships in a structured and scalable way.
